# Data

Included with these R scripts are 3 .csv files. The names of these files are hardcoded in the scripts.
In order for the scripts to work properly, these files must be in the R working directory and their names
must be unaltered. Each of these data sets are available publicly online.

Note: Minor alterations were made to the data sets linked below. 6 of the 303 observations in the cleveland
heart disease data set had missing values and were removed and the variables were labeled. The wisconsin breast
cancer diagnostic data set was also given variable names. The pima indians diabetes data set was completely
unaltered.

## Scripts

Each script should be run in paralell in separate R environments. Of course, they can be run sequentially
but the runtime is considerable. The output of each script should be a set of .Rdata files:
